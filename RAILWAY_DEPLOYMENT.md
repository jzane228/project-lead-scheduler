# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy the Project Lead Scheduler to Railway with automatic deployments and full uptime.

## Prerequisites
- [Railway Account](https://railway.app/) (Free tier)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- Your project code in a GitHub repository

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Push Your Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 1.2 Ensure These Files Are Present
- `railway.json` âœ…
- `Procfile` âœ…
- `.nixpacks` âœ…
- `package.json` with proper scripts âœ…
- `server/index.js` with health check endpoint âœ…

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### 2.1 Create Railway Account
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Complete the onboarding process

### 2.2 Create New Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your repository
4. Click "Deploy"

### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables
Railway will automatically detect your app. Now set up environment variables:

**Required Variables:**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5001
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-here
```

**Database Variables (Railway will provide these):**
```
DB_HOST=${DB_HOST}
DB_PORT=${DB_PORT}
DB_NAME=${DB_NAME}
DB_USER=${DB_USER}
DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
```

**Optional Variables:**
```
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-hubspot-token
SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-salesforce-token
```

### 2.4 Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project, click "New"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically link it to your app
4. The database variables will be automatically injected

## Step 3: Configure Automatic Deployments

### 3.1 Enable GitHub Integration
1. In your Railway project, go to "Settings"
2. Under "GitHub", ensure your repo is connected
3. Enable "Deploy on Push" for automatic deployments

### 3.2 Configure Branch Deployments
- **Main Branch**: Automatic deployment to production
- **Development Branches**: Can be configured for staging

## Step 4: Monitor Your Deployment

### 4.1 Check Deployment Status
- Railway dashboard shows real-time deployment status
- View logs in real-time
- Monitor resource usage

### 4.2 Health Check
Your app will be available at:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
- **Main App**: `https://your-app.railway.app`

## Step 5: Update Frontend Configuration

### 5.1 Update API Base URL
In your frontend, update the API base URL to your Railway domain:

```javascript
// In your frontend config
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-app.railway.app/api';
```

### 5.2 Update CORS Settings
Ensure your Railway app's CORS settings allow your frontend domain.

## Step 6: Continuous Development Workflow

### 6.1 Development Process
1. Make changes locally
2. Test locally
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Railway automatically deploys
5. Test in production

### 6.2 Rollback (if needed)
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your deployment
3. Select "Rollback" to previous version

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**
- Check Railway logs for error details
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify database environment variables
- Check if PostgreSQL service is running
- Ensure database is accessible from your app

**Port Issues:**
- Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable
- Your app should use `process.env.PORT`

### Getting Help
- Check Railway logs in real-time
- Railway Discord community
- Railway documentation

## Cost Management

### Free Tier Limits
- **Monthly Usage**: $5 credit (usually sufficient for development)
- **Concurrent Deployments**: 1
- **Custom Domains**: Available
- **SSL**: Automatic

### Monitoring Usage
- Check usage in Railway dashboard
- Set up usage alerts
- Optimize resource usage

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your app** following this guide
2. **Set up monitoring** and alerts
3. **Configure custom domain** (optional)
4. **Set up staging environment** (optional)
5. **Monitor performance** and optimize
